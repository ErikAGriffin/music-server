# Music Server
A web application that allows multiple users at a party or other social gathering to queue songs to a single device connected to speakers using Soundcloud.

Currently do to limitations on mobile devices concerning pre-loading of HTML5 audio, the device connected to speakers must be a computer, (not even an iPad).  As a result of this, I have stopped development in order to start focusing on native-mobile development.

However, if you are inclined to use a computer the app is fully functional and can be accessed at <a href="http://musicdrop.me">MusicDrop.me</a>.

<h4>To set-up plug in your computer to a set of speakers, and select the option to host a server.</h4>
* Then enter the code shown on your mobile device to connect to the server.
* Now you can search soundcloud and queue up as many songs as you like to the server, and music-playback will begin immediately.
* If someone else would like to join the server, they simply also enter the code on their mobile device.
* Music will now alternate sequentially between a song they have queued and songs you have queued.  Same goes if a third person joins.
The server will always ensure that everyone queueing a song will have it played, regardless of how many songs someone has queued before.
